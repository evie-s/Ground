# Ground
A website that provides simple grounding excercises to users who experience anxiety attacks.

 ❤ Ground was built to be a very simple website equipped with grounding tools to aid users who experience anxiety attacks.
 
  ❤ Due to only having one year of (more adequate) programming education, I decided to focus my 
                project on a simple, yet big problem communities of all sizes face: anxiety.
                
 ❤ While a little hard to open up about, I have struggled with anxiety my whole life. After the pandemic,
                I decided to spend my own money for a therapist for 3 months to learn skills to cope with my anxiety attacks.
                While I do not see her any more due to expenses, she has given me great tools which I thought I'd capstone in 
                this Hackathon.
                
❤ While I believe mental health should be talked about more, there are some situations where we feel
                more comfortable handling situations on our own, which is where Ground comes in. Whether you need a minute 
                to calm your mind at a party or work, you can simply pull up this application and use one of Ground's helpful
                grounding tools.
                
 My goal is to share what has worked for my anxiety attacks, and for Ground to have the
                 potential to help others cope with their mental health.
